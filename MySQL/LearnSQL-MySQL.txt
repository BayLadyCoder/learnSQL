Learn SQL -MySQL

SQL is the language we use to “talk” to our database
“Find all users”
“Add a  new User with Name Bay”
“Find all users who are 18 years old”


Quick Preview
“Find all users who are 18 or older”
==>> SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age >= 18;

MySQL is Database Management System
Relational Databases
(MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Many others) ==> All Use SQL

Two Takeaways
Once you learn SQL, it’s pretty easy to switch to another DB that uses SQL.
What makes database (DBMS) unique are the features they offer, not the language.
